# Hybrid Learning Experiments
Welcome to our project repository! Here you will find all the resources related to our hybrid learning experiments, where we have worked on improving the educational experience for both 'Roomies' and 'Zoomies'. Our journey has been focused on bridging the gap between in-person and remote learning.

## Overview

Our experimental research addresses the disparities in engagement, accessibility, and effectiveness between learners who are present in the classroom (Roomies) and those participating remotely (Zoomies). We have tested our hypothesis through various experimentations, replicating real-world hybrid learning environments.
